# Purpose
The purpose of this script is to provide a basic way for people to make their own custom Twitter publisher. This doesn't provide any fancy looks or code, just the functionality to connect to the Twitter API and create Tweets from a web page.
This can be used on its own to simply create Tweets, or you can use it to 
# How to use
1. Get the TwitterOAuth PHP library here: https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth
2. Download the files from this repository and upload them to your web server along with the TwitterOAuth library in its own folder.
3. Create an application at https://apps.twitter.com
4. Get the access tokens and consumer tokens for that app and fill in the applicable areas in `send.php`

Once you do all this you'll be able to go to `http://yourdomain.com/write.php` and create Tweets from there with your own fancy Twitter app

# License
I decided to use the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) because it allows anyone to do anything with this code, but it just asks that you give me a bit of credit for putting this together (I don't think that's asking too much).

# Thanks
Thank you for using my script and I hope it is useful :)
